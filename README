Fluke 8050A LCD Display
=======================

The purpose of this project is to replace the old LCD from a Fluke 8050A, which
is prone to both fading and blackening, with a modern LCD driven by a
microcontroller, in this case a Kendryte K210. The LCD is a module using a
NT35310 controller, in this case the LCD is one that came with the K210
development board. ST7789-based LCDs might be compatible.

The K210 is considerably overkill for this project, having two cores, a max
clock speed of 800 MHz, and an AI accelerator that will go completely unused.
It was simply something I had on hand, and it had some interesting features,
such as very flexible GPIO mapping.

The modification is relatively non-invasive, requiring simply tapping a number
of signal lines - these can either be soldered to, or by piggy-backing off the
Fluke's MCU socket - and removing the old LCD, which can be removed
non-destructively and can be replaced at any time.
